            <br>
            <p>
                <b> Our web Application name is Facial Expression Recognition so what does it means ? </b><br><br>A
                facial
                expression is
                one or
                more
                motions or positions of the muscles beneath the skin of the face. According to one
                set of controversial theories, these movements convey the emotional state of an individual to observers.
                Facial
                expressions are a form of nonverbal communication.

            </p>
            <br>
            <p>With 43 different muscles, our faces can make more
                than 10,000 facial expressions of emotion, called micro-expressions.
                However, several well-known universal facial expressions may be used to express emotion.</p>
            <br>

            <p><b>So now the question aries that what is the meaning of Facial expression recognition ?
                </b><br><br>Facial
                expression
                recognition software is a technology which uses biometric markers to detect emotions in human faces.
                More precisely, this technology is a sentiment analysis tool and is able to automatically detect the six
                basic or
                universal expressions: happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, fear, and disgust.</p>

            <br>
            <p>So here, in our webpage we are also detecting this universal expressions from the image,video or
                live.
            </p>

            <h1>Why we make this ?</h1>
            <br>
            <p>
                Facial expression recognition is important in communication, hence improving the quality of
                interaction between the
                human and robots.

                By using this technique to the advance level we can make the robots which can be
                able to recognize the human emotions.



            </p>
            <br>
            <p>

                Furthermore, the study of facial emotion recognition may contribute a better feedback
                to the society and also
                interaction between Human Robot Interface (HRI) in a near future.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>In
                research communities such as human computer interaction
                (HCI), neuroscience and computer vision, scientists have
                conducted extensive research to understand human emotions. Such studies would allow creating computers
                that can
                understand human emotions as well as ourselves.
            </p>

                <h2>Harcascade Algorithm </h2>
            </div>
            <br>

            <p>You see facial recognition everywhere, from the security camera in the front part of your house to your
                sensor. But how exactly does facial recognition work to classify faces, considering the large number
                of features as
                input and the striking similarities between humans?</p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Haar classifiers, classifiers that were used in the first real-time face detector. A Haar classifier, or
                a Haar cascade
                classifier, is a machine learning object detection program that identifies objects in an image and
                video.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                A detailed description of Haar classifiers can be seen in Paul Viola and Michael Jones’s paper “Rapid
                Object Detection
                using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features”

                <h2>Convolutional neural network </h2>
            </div>
            <br>

            <p>A convolutional neural network, or CNN, is a deep learning neural network designed for processing
                structured arrays of
                data such as images. Convolutional neural networks are widely used in computer vision and have become
                the state of the
                art for many visual applications such as image classification, and have also found success in natural
                language
                processing for text classification.</p>
            <br>

            <p>Convolutional neural networks are very good at picking up on patterns in the input image, such as lines,
                gradients,
                circles, or even eyes and faces. It is this property that makes convolutional neural networks so
                powerful for computer
                vision. Unlike earlier computer vision algorithms, convolutional neural networks can operate directly on
                a raw image and
                do not need any preprocessing.</p>
            <br>


            <p>Convolutional neural networks contain many convolutional layers stacked on top of each other, each one
                capable of
                recognizing more sophisticated shapes. With three or four convolutional layers it is possible to
                recognize handwritten
                digits and with 25 layers it is possible to distinguish human faces.</p>

            <br>
            <p>
                Kaggle Kernels is a cloud-based workbench for data science and machine learning. Allows data scientists
                to
                share code and
                analysis in Python and R. Over 150K "kernels" (code snippets) have been shared on Kaggle covering
                everything from
                sentiment analysis to object detection.
